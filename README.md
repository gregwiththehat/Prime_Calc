# Prime_Calc
Shout out to Avi, who made me think about prime numbers long enough to make this. 

The easiest way to do this seemed to be using the % expression to look for remainders. 

There's probably some importable library for prime calculation, isn't there?

Avi mentioned that he was sad that there weren't going to be any prime numbered years for a while. Not knowing when the next one was,
I wrote this program. On a whim, I decided to make it print the factors. Since it ran through all the numbers already,
it wouldn't be too difficult to just print them out.
